A simple prototype for making adjustments to dresses

## Building From Fresh Clone

 1. `npm install`
 2. `bower install`
 3. `grunt serve`

## General Dev Notes
 * `grunt build` will create a `dist` directory to be placed on production server
 * Directory structure isn't ideal IMO, but follows the Yeomen style. Follow it for the build process to go smoothly
 * Try to use directives as components where possible
 * No effort has gone into the client model, so everything is jammed in the controller (this is a prototype).
 * This project should be thrown out if going to build the real thing. Lots of shortcuts taken to get the prototype built quickly.
